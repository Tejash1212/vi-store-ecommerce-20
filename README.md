# üõçÔ∏è VI Store ‚Äì Modern E-commerce Web Application

**VI Store** is a full-stack e-commerce web app designed to showcase a production-ready shopping experience with a clean UI, fast performance, and a scalable codebase. It features a responsive product catalog, detailed product pages, cart and checkout flow, and an admin dashboard for managing inventory and orders. The project is structured as a client‚Äìserver monorepo using modern tooling (Vite + React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend, shared utilities/types), Tailwind CSS for styling, and simple cloud deployment presets (Netlify/Firebase). It‚Äôs built with developer experience in mind: typed configs, environment-based settings, and a predictable folder layout so contributors can jump in quickly.
